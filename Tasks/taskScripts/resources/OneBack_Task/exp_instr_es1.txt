In this task you will be presented with a set of shapes 
on either side of the centre of the screen.

Sometimes, instead of shapes, you will see a pair of question marks appear on 
either side of the screen and a shape will be presented in the centre of the screen.

Your task is to lets us know what shape on the prior trial 
matched the shape shown on screen now.
