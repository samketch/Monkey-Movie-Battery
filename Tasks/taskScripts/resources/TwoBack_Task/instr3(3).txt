For example, if the 
images were of letters, 
suppose you were presented 
an image of the letter 'K'.

If the order of the images were: 
['L', ''K'', 'M', ''K''],
then you would press 
the RIGHT arrow key, 
since a 'K' was presented 
two images before.

If the order was, say: 
['L', 'M', ''K'', ''K''] or 
[''K'', 'L', 'M', ''K''], 
then you would press 
the LEFT arrow key.
