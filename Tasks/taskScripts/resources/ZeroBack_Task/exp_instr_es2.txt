When this happens you will be asked to decide which of the shapes is 
the same as the one in the centre. 

If the shape on the left matches the one in the centre, press the left arrow key.

If the shape on the right matches the one in the centre, press the right arrow key. 

You only need to make a response on the trials when shapes are presented in the center.
